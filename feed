<p>Flowers, by the bride, photo by Miss Gen via Bridal Musings This is my main advice if you are planning to make your own flowers for your wedding.

<h2 id="17">Know where your florist sources his flowers</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you interview florists, one of the questions you should ask is where they source the flowers they use. Believe it or not, this plays a huge role in the sustainability of your floral arrangements. Imported flowers are less sustainable because of the resources it takes to transport them to you. Many imported flowers are grown on farms that don't care about having a positive impact on the environment. so that's something to think about as well. Florists who use locally grown flowers are more environmentally friendly, and you can also feel good about supporting the local community where the flowers are being grown.</p>

<p>Hiring a florist to take care of all the little details is tempting. An experienced florist has probably done it before. Buying floral wedding decorations from a florist may be the more convenient route. You pay more so you can check something off your long list of wedding to-dos. There's nothing wrong with that, but consider the perks and benefits of DIY floral wedding decorations before leaving everything to a florist. While you should definitely hire an experienced florist to take care of bouquets, boutonnieres, and corsages, consider tackling some smaller items yourself to save some money.</p>
